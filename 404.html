<h1>Oh, shit, 404</h1>

<p>
  Yeah, it happens. The web, much as we'd like it to be, isn't as static as we thought. So things disappear. You have three ways of finding them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/">web.archive.org</a> and enter the URL you originally used to get here. There's a real chance that it'll be on there.</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:404@jml.is">Send me an email</a> and I'll import the old post into Jekyll and notify you as soon as that happens.</li>
  <li><a href="/">Enjoy what's left and new</a>.</li>
</ul>
