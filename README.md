# jml.is

As seen on [jml.is](http://jml.is). A basic Jekyll website. Some things include a \_data driven trail index ([live](http://jml.is/e1/)), links generated from [diigo](http://diigo.com) saved bookmarks, Gulp.js postprocessing, native ads (I am using those to promote non-profit causes and thank my sponsors, ads are evil), bing maps includes (caching missing), embedly plugin, flickr sets, embedded tweets, etc.
